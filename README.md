## Overview
Google Play Services are essential components on most Android devices. They allow you to access your Google account seamlessly and provide Google-specific features for apps that depend on them.
<br>However, when you flash custom ROMs without Google Play Services or opt for alternatives like [microG](https://microg.org/), certain apps may encounter issues ‚Äî either not functioning at all or experiencing limitations in specific features.

Plexus provides detailed insights into app compatibility whether you‚Äôre using ROMs without Google Play Services (like _LineageOS_) or ROMs with microG (such as _CalyxOS_). It helps you identify which apps work, don‚Äôt work or have limited features.
<br>All the information is crowdsourced by the community, for the community.
